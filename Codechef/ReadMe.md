This projeact has been created for codechef [DEVWEEKEND01](https://www.codechef.com/DEVWEEKEND01) with the help of codechef.

It generate a secret code and store it, then asks the user to enter their guess.
The guess needs to be a 4 digit string.

for each digit at correct place, the system will return a bull and digit to be present but not at the correct position, the system will return a cow.

eg:- if secret code is 3467 and user guess is 0964
The system will return bulls = 1 for 6 at position 3 and will return a cow for 4.

The user needs to guess the code in 10 attempts or lose.

have fun.
